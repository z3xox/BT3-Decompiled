 * Menu overlay DBZP.BIN, 0x34D368..0x351C38 (placeholder stem "menu_f"): the last three functions of the
 * TeamSel object, the team select screen of the versus modes (up to five characters per side, then the stage
 * and the music, then the battle setup): TeamSel_Update, TeamSel_Input, TeamSel_Run.
 *
 * The head of the object is the previous chunk (include/menu/menu_e.h); the object ends exactly at 0x351C38,
 * where the ItemPanel code begins. The two chunks are ONE source file, src/menu/team_select.c (merged):
 * TeamSel_Input matches only when TeamSel_ClipGoto, TeamSel_SetChips and TeamSel_RequestFace are defined
 * above it.
 *
 * The layouts (TeamSel, TeamSelSide, TsMember, ...) are those of menu_e.h, included above; this header holds
 * only what the second chunk added.

 * is confirmed, on 0xA3 it opens the list of the fourteen saved custom characters.
