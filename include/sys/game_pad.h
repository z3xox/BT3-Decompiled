/* Game-level input layer, src/sys/game_pad.c = 0x2574F0..0x257870 (five functions).
   Before it (..0x2574F0) is matrix/quaternion maths, after it (0x257870..) a list-pool module.

   == The game button word (Pad.gameHeld / gamePressed / gameRepeat, +0x188 / +0x18C / +0x190) ==
   Built once per frame per port by Pad_UpdateGameButtons, called from Pad_Update (pad.c) right after the
   raw read. The mapping is FIXED: no table, no key config, the same for both ports. Each bit is one
   Pad_IsHeld(pad, rawMask) test on Pad.held (PAD_* bits, see pad.h):

   The left stick's digital bits (PAD_LSTICK_*) are not mapped. The analog sticks are copied unchanged to
   gameLeft / gameRight (+0x1A4 / +0x1AC).
     gamePressed = gameHeld & ~(gameHeld of the previous frame)
     gameRepeat  = Pad_CalcRepeat(gameHeld, gamePressed, &gameRepeatTimer, &gameRepeatLast, repeatDelay, repeatInterval)
   Pad_Reset (pad.c) zeroes gameHeld/gamePressed/gameRepeat and the timer when the port has no usable pad;
   it does not touch gameLeft/gameRight, which keep their last value until the next successful read.

   == Repeat (Pad_CalcRepeat) ==
   Works on the whole word, not per bit. While held is non-zero and identical to the previous frame's, the
   timer counts down; when it goes below zero it is reloaded with `interval` and the whole held word is
   returned. Any change of held (including to 0, and held == 0 itself) reloads the timer with `delay` and
   returns nothing. A non-zero pressed always overrides the result. So with delay D and interval I a button
   reports on frame 0, then on frame D+1, then every I+1 frames. Pad_Init sets D = 20, I = 1; the same
   delay/interval pair also drives the raw Pad.repeat word. Pad_SetRepeat changes it for both ports
   (callers: Shen_Main in the main executable, with (20, 1) and later (40, 3); Progress_Main in the
   menu overlay, twice).

   == Who reads it ==
   There are no reader functions for the game button word: every user reads gPad[n] fields directly
   (lui/lw on gPad + 0x18C etc.). Menus, the overlay and the debug screens use gamePressed and gameRepeat
   (occasionally gameHeld, gameLeft/gameRight); see the report for the list. Pad_GetStatus has no callers,
   Pad_GetLastStatus one (BtlMenu_Update, the pause menu).

   == Battle does NOT use the game button word ==
   Fights read the RAW word and go through their own per-player key config (battle code, not this file):
     BtlInput_Sample(chr)  samples gPad[chr->padIndex] (via BtlChar_GetPad): status, lastStatus, raw Pad.held
                         (+0x148) and the left stick (+0x130/+0x134, quantised to a byte, 0x7F = centre)
                         into chr+0x570, then BtlInput_BuildRecord turns that into a 16-byte record at chr+0x938:
                         'O','P','R','T', player, 0, stickX, stickY, u32 buttons, u32 commands.
     BtlInput_RemapButtons(rawHeld, table)  the remap: battle bit i is set when rawHeld & table[i] (bit 15 needs
                         all bits of its mask). table = 31 raw PAD_* masks at chr+0x578.
     BtlInput_BuildMaskTable(chr)  builds that table from the key config: BtlInput_GetKeyMask(chr, action) looks `action`
                         up in gSaveData->keyConfig[player][8] (s32, gSaveData + 0x160C + player * 0x20; a
                         backup copy sits at + 0x164C) and returns the matching entry of its local padBit[] (rodata copy at 0x2EF050) =
                         { CIRCLE, CROSS, SQUARE, TRIANGLE, L1, L2, R1, R2 }. The option menu's default
                         (overlay 0x3A296C) is keyConfig = { 2, 1, 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 }.
     BtlInput_Update(chr)  pushes the record through an 8-entry ring (chr+0x8C0..) and derives the per-frame
                         held/prev/pressed/released words at chr+0x73C/0x740/0x744/0x748 (buttons) and
                         chr+0x74C.. (commands).
     readers             BtlInput_IsHeld (held), BtlInput_IsPressed (pressed), BtlInput_IsReleased (released),
                         BtlInput_IsHeldNotPrev, BtlInput_IsCmdPressed/4E50/4E60 (command word), BtlInput_GetHeldFrames.. (frame counters).
   The battle button/command word, not gameHeld, is what a fight consumes each frame. */
