/*
 * Character change requests and the "time stopped" word: 0x1D60A0..0x1D6438.
 *
 * The roster holds a ring of up to 7 requests (roster + 0x138, 0x140 bytes). A fighter that transforms, fuses,
 * switches member or needs an extra object pushes a request (BtlChange_RequestChara / BtlChange_RequestObject,
 * called from the fighter state machine); the battle loader (src/battle/battle_load.c) serves one at a time:
 *
 *   state 0  idle
 *   state 1  BtlChange_Update (end of every frame, also while paused) popped the request: it is now `cur`
 *   state 2  BtlChange_SetTaken   the loader created its job (through BtlChange_NotifyTaken)
 *   state 3  BtlChange_SetLoaded  the files are in memory (through BtlChange_NotifyLoaded); `loaded` = 1
 *   state 4  BtlChange_SetReady   the owning fighter allows the swap (the loader waits for this, BtlChange_IsReady)
 *   state 5  BtlChange_SetDone    the owning fighter is finished; the next BtlChange_Update clears `cur`
 *
 * roster + 0x274 (`timeStop`, BtlChars_IsTimeStopped) is written only by BtlChange_Update and BtlChange_Reset:
 * it is 1 on every frame that ends with an active request and 0 otherwise. A request that finishes and a queued
 * one that starts in the same BtlChange_Update keep it at 1 without a gap.
