/*
 * Event 34: the shell game. One of five figures holds the mark; it is shown, the figures are swapped in pairs
 * (param swaps at one of three speeds), then the player picks one: left / right (gameRepeat 1 / 2), confirm
 * (gamePressed 0x200). Right = points and defence (USimTrain.points / gain), wrong = USimTrain.loss on defence.
 * After the switch every frame places the mark and sets each figure's pictures.
 *
 * NOT MATCHING: 15 of 551 instructions, all in case 6 (0x3922EC..0x392328): the same instructions with other
 * registers and another order of the five stores (the original keeps the Rand_Range result in $v0 until the index
 * arithmetic is done and gives the three other address registers $a2 / $a3 / $a1; this attempt stores the result
 * at once). Every statement order, a temporary for the result, a split load of the speed and chained zero stores
 * were tried (build/scratch_menu_u/perm3.py .. perm6.py). Everything else, including the jump table and the
 * strings, is identical with every relocation applied (build/scratch_menu_u/linkcheck.py). The attempt is
 * behaviourally exact. Verified by enabling it; fdiff then reports the 15 instructions.
 *
 * Cleanup notes (build/scratch_cleanup2_I/ev*.py, rtl/ud.*): the high halves of the five addresses are not
 * local to case 6. The global CSE pass makes `%hi(gSimPopoTarget)` one register for the whole function and
 * copies it into every case that reaches the code behind the switch, so the place of that `lui` in case 6
 * follows from the whole function, and a change in case 6 moves registers in case 16 (0x392450). With the
 * result in a temporary and the order Count, Speed, Won, Target the three other `lui` come out as in the
 * original (a2 / a3 / a1, in that order) but the store of the target then follows the two zero stores (10
 * instructions, two of them in case 16); chained zero stores and a pointer to the table row change nothing.
 * The original has the target's `lui` last and its store first.
 *
 * 2026-10-08 (build/scratch_shell_burst/try34*.py, viz.sh; scheduler traces in rtl/): what the original's order
 * requires, measured on the first scheduling pass. The statement order is Count, Speed, Won with the Rand_Range
 * result held in a temporary (then rank is in $a0, the index in $v1, the three other `lui` in $a2 / $a3 / $a1 as
 * in the original), and the store of the target has to be issued between the `addu` of the index and the load of
 * the speed, so that reload gives its `lui` the register rank has just left ($a0) and the speed gets $v0. It
 * cannot be, in any form tried: gcse's shared register for `%hi(gSimPopoTarget)` (r580, set in every case) has
 * no known base address, so the scheduler makes the store conflict with the load of gSimTrain2[].speed; written
 * in front of that load the store gets the block's highest priority and is issued at once (this attempt, 15
 * instructions), written behind it the store follows the load (10 instructions). With an address the
 * scheduler can resolve the store has the priority of the two zero stores and lands exactly where the original
 * has it (probe: the same store through `extern s32 gT6 __asm__("gSimPopoTarget")`, which gcse treats as another
 * symbol), but its `lui` is then an ordinary block-local register that overlaps rank ($a0 / $a1 exchanged, 10 and
 * 7 instructions). So the original needs both: the shared, rematerialised high part AND no conflict with the
 * table load. Not found; temporaries of every integer type, pointers to the global and all 24 statement orders
 * give one of the three results above.
